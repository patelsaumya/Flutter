3 Trees

-> Widget Tree
    -> Combination of widgets in your code
    -> build() is called very frequently to check for required updates
-> Element Tree
    -> In-memory representation of your widgets
    -> Used for determining necessary UI updates
    -> Initially created after build()
    -> Elements are re-used if possible
    -> If, element skeleton stays the same,
       then Flutter only updates the widget references + UI output if necessary
    -> State objects are connected to the elements
    -> Key is an additional identification criteria allowing Flutter to match elements to widgets.
       Flutter is able to make sure that every widget has exactly the element with exactly the state it needs.
-> Render Tree
    -> The visible UI building blocks
    -> Updated when determined via element tree comparisons
    -> Re-rendered if needed
    -> Only (partially) re-rendered if UI updates are needed


Variable Define Keywords (things allowed)

-> var
    -> var numbers = [1,2,3];
       numbers = [4,5,6];
-> final
    -> final numbers = [1,2,3];
       numbers.add(4);
-> const
    -> const numbers = [1,2,3];
